Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website, built using React (bootstrapped with Create React App). The project showcases my skills, projects, resume, and contact information. The site is fully responsive and styled using modern CSS techniques.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the portfolio site in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the site for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you need full control over the configuration, you can eject at any time.
This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
